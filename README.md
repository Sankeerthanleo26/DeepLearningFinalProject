# Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning

Crop Disease Detection using Deep Learning is a project aimed at leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically identify and classify plant diseases from images of plant leaves. By harnessing the power of deep learning, this project provides a scalable and efficient solution for early disease detection in crops, thereby helping farmers mitigate crop losses and optimize agricultural practices.

## Overview26

Crop diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, leading to substantial crop losses and economic damages. Traditional methods of disease identification are often labor-intensive and time-consuming, making it challenging for farmers to detect diseases early and take timely preventive measures. This project addresses this challenge by providing an automated solution for crop disease detection using deep learning techniques.

## Features

- Image preprocessing: The project preprocesses input images to standardize their size and format before feeding them into the deep learning model.
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A CNN architecture is employed to analyze plant images and identify disease symptoms with high accuracy.
- Data Augmentation: Data augmentation techniques are applied to increase the diversity of training samples and improve the robustness of the model.
- Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using validation data to assess its performance in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Predictive System: A predictive system is implemented to classify new images of plant leaves and provide real-time insights into the presence of diseases.

## Installation

To install the required dependencies for running the project, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:

   pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To use the crop disease detection system, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your dataset: Organize your dataset of plant images into appropriate directories with subfolders representing different classes of diseases.

2. Train the model: Use the provided scripts to train the CNN model on your dataset. Adjust hyperparameters as needed and monitor training progress.

3. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the trained model using validation data to assess its performance and fine-tune as necessary.

4. Predict disease: Use the predictive system to classify new images of plant leaves and identify the presence of diseases.

## Model Training

For model training, the following steps are involved:

1. Data preprocessing: Preprocess the input images, including resizing, normalization, and data augmentation.

2. Model definition: Define the architecture of the CNN model, including convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

3. Model compilation: Compile the model with appropriate loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metrics.

4. Training: Train the model using the prepared dataset, monitoring training progress and adjusting parameters as needed.

## Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on a separate validation dataset.

## Future Work

Future enhancements and improvements to the project may include:

- Integration with agricultural drones or IoT devices for real-time disease monitoring in large-scale farms.
- Exploration of transfer learning techniques to leverage pre-trained models for improved performance on smaller datasets.
- Deployment of the predictive system as a web or mobile application for easy access by farmers and agricultural experts.
